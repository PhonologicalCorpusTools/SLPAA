Sign Type
***********

This module is where users identify the overarching ‘kind’ of sign by selecting specifications for the behaviours of each hand (H1 & H2) in relation to each other. 


I.II. =====
abc ~~~~~~~~~

.. _signtype_number_hands: 

1. Number of hands
```````````````````

I. 1 hand
=========
This is selected if the sign only involved one hand, regardless of movement, contact etc. 

- "The hand moves" is selected if the hand is involved in either a perceptual shape [`NORTH <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=north>`_] or a joint-specific movement [`APPLE <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=apple>`_] **also includes finger spelled signs?** if yes, give example. 

- "The hand does not move" is selected if the hand is not nvolved in any movement, such as [ONE].

II. 2 hands
=========
This is selected if both **hands** are involved in the sign in some way. **(add a note about what to do if the ARM is involved, such as WHALE, CRACKER, TRASH, and even TIME, where the wrist is involved. Signs where the forearm is parallel to the ground, this selection will be available in PDHS module)**

a) Handshape relation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- "H1 and H2 involve the same set(s) of handshapes" is selected if the handshapes throughout the entire sign remain the same between both hands **[e.g....]**

- "H1 and H2 involve different set(s) of handshapes " is selected if the two hands have different handshapes from each other in at least one part of the sign **[e.g EVERY-YEAR, MOUNTAIN]** https://www.signingsavvy.com/sign/EVERY+YEAR
