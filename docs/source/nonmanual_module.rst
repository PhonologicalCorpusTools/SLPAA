*****************
Nonmanual Module
*****************

This :ref:`module` is used to code the **nonmanual** components of a sign. As many :ref:`instances<instance>` of this module as necessary can be called for any given sign coding, although this module in particular is designed so that all of the nonmanual information for the sign can be coded at once (see the note below). For more discussion on the use of modules in SLP-AA to encode information about signs, see :ref:`modularity`.

Module instances link to generic :ref:`x-slots<x_slot>` to record information about their timing relative to any others within a sign. For more information on the use of x-slots in SLP-AA, consult :ref:`timing_page`. 

.. note::
    **X-slot selection**
    
    This module is atypical in how it is associated with timing values ...
