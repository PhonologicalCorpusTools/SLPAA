.. _cardinal_axes:

cardinal axes
=============
A set of three axes in space that are all perpendicular to one another and cross at a point of origin. Each axis extends in two directions. No matter where the point of origin lands or how a given axis is oriented, these always remain positioned the same way relative to each other. 


.. _cardinal_planes:

cardinal planes
===============
A set of three planes in space that are all perpendicular to one another and cross at a point of origin. Each plane extends on a flat surface in every possible direction, including along two :ref:`cardinal_axes` (and perpendicular to the third). No matter where the point of origin lands or how a given plane is oriented, these always remain positioned the same way relative to each other.


.. _closing_opening:

closing/opening
===============
Closing: flexion of all joints of the selected fingers, such that the handshape becomes "closed" compared to the starting configuration.

Opening: extension of all joints of the selected fingers, such that the handshape "opens up" compared to the starting configuration.

.. _contralateral:

contralateral
=============
This refers to a side of the body relative to a pertinent hand of the signer: in this case, it is the opposite side of the body from the hand that is under discussion. The hand would have to cross laterally over the :ref:`mid_sagittal_plane` to reach this side.

The H2 side of the signer's body is contralateral to H1, and the H1 side of the signer's body is contralateral to H2.

A unique identifier for each entry in a corpus. Choices for how these are defined are set within the :ref:`global_settings` section.

.. _handshape: 

handshape
=========
Holistic description of a standard phonological handshape, e.g., the 'B' handshape in ASL. In SLP-AA, there is a set of :ref:`predefined_handshapes` whose full :ref:`hand_configuration` is already specified in the :ref:`hand_configuration_module`.


.. _handshape_change:

handshape change
================
A "handshape change" is one of the three primary types of movement that are coded in SLP-AA (the other two being :ref:`perceptual_shape` and :ref:`joint_specific_movement`). Handshape changes occur whenever there is a change in handshape during the production of the sign that cannot be described as a simple movement of one joint / set of joints (like closing, opening, or twisting). This typically occurs in fingerspellings, compound signs, and initialized signs. Note that in certain cases, a sign may have a handshape change concurrently with a perceptual shape movement.


.. _hand_configuration: 

hand configuration
==================
Phonetic details of the hand coded in the :ref:`hand_configuration_module`. May include variation from a standard :ref:`handshape`.

.. _instance:

instance
========
A single instance of a :ref:`module` is a completed coding of the necessary selections within that type of module. The set of selections are decided by the user, and any part (or all) of this set can be accessed and edited through the :ref:`Sign summary window<sign_summary>`. A fully-coded sign in a corpus is then made up of its :ref:`sign_level_info`, its :ref:`sign_type` specifications, and the necessary instances of each type of module.


.. _ipsilateral:

ipsilateral
===========
This refers to a side of the body relative to a pertinent hand of the signer: in this case, it is the same side of the body as the hand that is under discussion. The hand can remain laterally on the same side of the :ref:`mid_sagittal_plane` to reach this side.

The H1 side of the signer's body is ipsilateral to H1, and the H2 side of the signer's body is ipsilateral to H2.


.. _joint_specific_movement:

joint-specific movement
=======================
A "joint-specific movement" is one of the three primary types of movement that are coded in SLP-AA (the other two being :ref:`perceptual_shape` and :ref:`handshape_change`). These movements are characterized as being produced based on and understood by the movements of the joints involved in the motion. The default list of joint movements that can be selected for this movement type can be found in the :ref:`Joint-specific movements<joint_specific_movement_entry>` section.

Joint-specific movements are often comparable to traditional 'local' movements, except that this selection only applies when the movement can be characterized solely based on a particular change in joint articulation. There is some possible overlap between perceptual shape and joint-specific movements in some cases, so care should be taken when selecting between these. For example, flexion of the selected finger base joints could either be coded as :ref:`flattening<flattening_straightening>` or as a "straight" perceptual shape.

.. comment::
  This example is meant to show that the choice between 'perceptual shape' and 'joint-specific movement' is a phonological one in the cases where either one could reasonably apply. The difference is not purely articulatory. This is also true for traditional terms like 'path' and 'local' movements.

.. _mid_sagittal_plane:

mid-sagittal plane
==================
The particular sagittal plane that is centered directly at the midline of the body. The body is bilaterally symmetric across this plane, so it must be given special considerations in terms of :ref:`Symmetry<symmetry_section>`.


.. _module:

module
======
This term is used to describe the full set of possible selections available to choose from for a given type of module in SLP-AA: these are the :ref:`movement_module`, the :ref:`hand_part_module`, the :ref:`location_module`, the :ref:`relation_module`, the :ref:`orientation_module`, the :ref:`hand_configuration_module`, and the :ref:`nonmanual_module`. When not referenced in connection to a particular type of module, this term applies abstractly to the modular functionality of the program. For more information, visit the :ref:`modularity` section.

See :ref:`instance` of a module.

.. _perceptual_shape:

perceptual shape
================
A "perceptual shape" is one of the three primary types of movement that are coded in SLP-AA (the other two being :ref:`handshape_change` and :ref:`joint_specific_movement`). These movements are characterized as being produced based on and understood by the shapes that they trace out, either in the signing space or on the body, regardless of the joints involved in the motion. The default list of shapes that can be selected for this movement type can be found in the :ref:`Shape<shape_entry>` section.

Perceptual shape movements are often comparable to traditional 'path' / 'major' / 'primary' movements, with the exception that there is no distinction at this level for shapes produced by joints that are more proximal or more distal to the body, although that distinction can be recorded in the :ref:`Joint activity<joint_activity_entry>` section. There is some possible overlap between perceptual shape and joint-specific movements in some cases, so care should be taken when selecting between these. For example, flexion of the selected finger base joints could either be coded as :ref:`flattening<flattening_straightening>` or as a "straight" perceptual shape.

.. comment::
  This example is meant to show that the choice between 'perceptual shape' and 'joint-specific movement' is a phonological one in the cases where either one could reasonably apply. The difference is not purely articulatory. This is also true for traditional terms like 'path' and 'local' movements.

Note that the options are 'Radial' and 'Ulnar', but I don't think that we typically differentiate with separate terms (like "ulnar pivoting", for example).

.. _spreading_unspreading:

spreading/un-spreading

Spreading: abduction of the base joints of the selected fingers, such that the fingers become spread apart.

Un-spreading: adduction of the base joints of the selected fingers, such that the fingers are brought together.

.. _twisting:

twisting
========
**add here** 

Note: This is labelled as 'Twisting' in the system overview and in the program, but the sub-options 'Pronation' and 'Supination' are also frequently used to describe their specific directions of movement.

.. _wiggling_fluttering:

wiggling/fluttering
===================
Extension *and* flexion of base joints of the selected fingers independently from each other, such that the fingers wiggle/flutter.

Note: the only joint-specific movement that does not have binary direction sub-options. (the slash in this case is meant to show interchangeability, whereas in all other cases it shows contrast. edit this to make it more clear.)
