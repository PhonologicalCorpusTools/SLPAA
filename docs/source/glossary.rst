.. _closing_opening:

closing/opening
===============
Closing: flexion of all joints of the selected fingers, such that the handshape becomes "closed" compared to the starting configuration. This movement is seen in the sign `MILK_2 <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=milk_2>`_. *insert link to video example*

Opening: extension of all joints of the selected fingers, such that the handshape "opens up" compared to the starting configuration. This movement is seen in the sign `BOWTIE <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=bowtie>`_. *insert link to video example*

.. _handshape: 

handshape
=========
Holistic description of a standard phonological handshape, e.g., the 'B' handshape in ASL. In SLP-AA, there are 'pre-defined' handshapes whose full :ref:`hand_configuration` is already specified in the :ref:`hand_configuration_module`.


.. _handshape_change:

handshape change
================
A "handshape change" is one of the three primary types of movement that are coded in SLP-AA (the other two being :ref:`perceptual_shape` and :ref:`joint_specific_movement`). Handshape changes occur whenever there is a change in handshape during the production of the sign that cannot   be described as a simple movement of one joint / set of joints (like closing, opening, or twisting). This typically occurs in fingerspellings (as in `BUS <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=bus>`_), compound signs (as in `DESERT <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=desert>`_), and initialized signs (as in `HIGH_SCHOOL <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=high_school>`_). Note that in certain cases, a sign may have both a handshape change and a perceptual shape movement (as in `STYLE <https://www.handspeak.com/word/index.php?id=4174>`_).


.. _hand_configuration: 

hand configuration
==================
Phonetic details of the hand coded in the :ref:`hand_configuration_module`. May include variation from a standard :ref:`handshape`.

joint-specific movement
=======================
NT - add here [use the stuff below to start]
A "joint-specific movement" is one of the three primary types of movement that are coded in SLP-AA (the other two being :ref:`perceptual_shape` and :ref:`handshape_change`).

.. _perceptual_shape:

perceptual shape
================

A "perceptual shape" is one of the three primary types of movement that are coded in SLP-AA (the other two being :ref:`handshape_change` and :ref:`joint_specific_movement`). These movements are characterized as being produced based on and understood by the shapes that they trace out in the signing space, regardless of the joints involved in the motion. The default list of shapes that can be selected for this movement type can be found in the :ref:`shape<shape_entry>` section.

Perceptual shape movements are comparable to traditional 'path' / 'major' / 'primary' movements, with the exception that there is no distinction at this level for shapes produced by joints that are more proximal or more distal to the body, although that distinction can be recorded in the :ref:`joint activity<joint_activity_entry>` section. There is some possible overlap between perceptual shape and joint-specific movements in some cases, so care should be taken when selecting between these. A straight movement that is produced by flexing the finger base joints could be coded as :ref:`flattening<flattening_straightening>` and vice versa, for example.

.. _spreading_unspreading:

spreading/un-spreading
=====================
Spreading: abduction of the base joints of the selected fingers, such that the fingers spread apart. This movement is seen in the sign `SEND <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=send>`_. *insert link to video*

Un-spreading: adduction of the base joints of the selected fingers, such that the fingers are brought together. This movement is seen in the sign `RUN_OUT_OF <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=run_out_of>`_ and `SCISSORS <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=scissors>`_. *insert link to video*
