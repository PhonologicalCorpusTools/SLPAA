.. _closing_opening:

closing/opening
===============
Closing: flexion of all joints of the selected fingers, such that the handshape becomes "closed" compared to the starting configuration. This movement is seen in the sign `MILK_2 <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=milk_2>`_. *insert link to video example*

Opening: extension of all joints of the selected fingers, such that the handshape "opens up" compared to the starting configuration. This movement is seen in the sign `BOWTIE <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=bowtie>`_. *insert link to video example*


.. _entry_ID: 

entry ID
========
A unique identifier for each entry in a corpus. Choices for how these are defined are set within the :ref:`global_options` section.

.. _handshape: 

handshape
======
Holistic description of a standard phonological handshape, e.g., the 'B' handshape in ASL. In SLP-AA, there are 'pre-defined' handshapes whose full :ref:`hand_configuration` is already specified in the :ref:`hand_configuration_module`.


.. _handshape_change:

handshape change
======
A "handshape change" is one of the three primary types of movement that are coded in SLP-AA (the other two being :ref:`perceptual_shape` and :ref:`joint_specific_movement`). Handshape changes occur whenever there is a change in handshape during the production of the sign that cannot   be described as a simple movement of one joint / set of joints (like closing, opening, or twisting). This typically occurs in fingerspellings (as in `BUS <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=bus>`_), compound signs (as in `DESERT <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=desert>`_), and initialized signs (as in `HIGH_SCHOOL <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=high_school>`_). Note that in certain cases, a sign may have both a handshape change and a perceptual shape movement (as in `STYLE <https://www.handspeak.com/word/index.php?id=4174>`_).

.. _hand_configuration: 

hand configuration
======
Phonetic details of the hand coded in the :ref:`hand_configuration_module`. May include variation from a standard :ref:`handshape`.


.. _hooking_unhooking:

.. _joint_specific_movement:

joint-specific movement
=======================
NT - add here [use the stuff below to start]
A "joint-specific movement" is one of the three primary types of movement that are coded in SLP-AA (the other two being :ref:`perceptual_shape` and :ref:`handshape_change`).

================
NT - add here [use the stuff below to start]

A "perceptual shape" is one of the three primary types of movement that are coded in SLP-AA (the other two being :ref:`handshape_change` and :ref:`joint_specific_movement`).

.. _spreading_unspreading:

spreading/un-spreading
=====================
Spreading: abduction of the base joints of the selected fingers, such that the fingers spread apart. This movement is seen in the sign `SEND <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=send>`_. *insert link to video*

Un-spreading: adduction of the base joints of the selected fingers, such that the fingers are brought together. This movement is seen in the sign `RUN_OUT_OF <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=run_out_of>`_ and `SCISSORS <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=scissors>`_. *insert link to video*

.. _wiggling_fluttering:

wiggling/fluttering
===================
Extension *and* flexion of base joints of the selected fingers independently from each other, such that the fingers wiggle/flutter. This movement is seen in the signs  `DIRTY <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=dirty>`_ or `SALT <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=salt>`_. *insert link to video*
