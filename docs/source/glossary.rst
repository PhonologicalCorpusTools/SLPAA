.. _entry_ID: 

entry ID
========
A unique identifier for each entry in a corpus. Choices for how these are defined are set within the :ref:`global_options` section.


.. _flattening_straightening:

.. _gloss:

.. _handshape: 

handshape
======
Holistic description of a standard phonological handshape, e.g., the 'B' handshape in ASL. In SLP-AA, there are 'pre-defined' handshapes whose full :ref:`hand_configuration` is already specified in the :ref:`hand_configuration_module`.


.. _handshape_change:

handshape change
======
A "handshape change" is one of the three primary types of movement that are coded in SLP-AA (the other two being :ref:`perceptual_shape` and :ref:`joint_specific_movement`). Handshape changes occur whenever there is a change in handshape during the production of the sign that cannot   be described as a simple movement of one joint / set of joints (like closing, opening, or twisting). This typically occurs in fingerspellings (as in `BUS <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=bus>`_), compound signs (as in `DESERT <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=desert>`_), and initialized signs (as in `HIGH_SCHOOL <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=high_school>`_). Note that in certain cases, a sign may have both a handshape change and a perceptual shape movement (as in `STYLE <https://www.handspeak.com/word/index.php?id=4174>`_).

.. _hand_configuration: 

hand configuration
======
Phonetic details of the hand coded in the :ref:`hand_configuration_module`. May include variation from a standard :ref:`handshape`.


.. _hooking_unhooking:

hooking/un-hooking
========

.. _joint_specific_movement:

joint-specific movement
=======================
NT - add here [use the stuff below to start]
A "joint-specific movement" is one of the three primary types of movement that are coded in SLP-AA (the other two being :ref:`perceptual_shape` and :ref:`handshape_change`).

.. _perceptual_shape:

perceptual shape
================
NT - add here [use the stuff below to start]

A "perceptual shape" is one of the three primary types of movement that are coded in SLP-AA (the other two being :ref:`handshape_change` and :ref:`joint_specific_movement`).
