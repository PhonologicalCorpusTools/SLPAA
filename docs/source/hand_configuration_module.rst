**************************
Hand Configuration Module
**************************

This :ref:`module` is used to code the **hand configuration** components of a sign. As many :ref:`instances<instance>` of this module as necessary can be called for any given sign coding. For more discussion on the use of modules in SLP-AA to encode information about signs, see :ref:`modularity`.

Select the hand(s) involved in this instance of the module.

Module instances link to generic :ref:`x-slots<x_slot>` to record information about their timing relative to any others within a sign. For more information on the use of x-slots in SLP-AA, consult :ref:`timing_page`.



(terminology: :ref:`hand_configuration` to mean something slightly different than :ref:`handshape`.)

See the list of :ref:`predefined_handshapes`.
