            Changing x-slot settings partway through creating a corpus

  This will also include a section on how modules get linked to x-slots, but this may end up moving if it fits better elsewhere

****************
Timing & X-Slots
****************

**Introduction. Link to: x-slot glossary entry, global settings (options wrt generation of x-slots as well as subdivisions), auto-generation, mention timing as relevant to selecting sign type options.**

.. _adding_x-slots:

1. Adding x-slots
`````````````````

**Description** You can choose whether the number of x-slots is manually specified by the user for each sign before coding, or if it will be automatically determined by the program based on the movement modules, or you can choose to disable the use of x-slots completely.

Notes: Explain what an x-slot does/does not represent. Explain partial x-slots at the end, and internal divisions within complete x-slots (what works best here for concrete examples? contact/location/handpart?). Focus on functionality first, then give some examples of why these features may be useful for specific signs.
