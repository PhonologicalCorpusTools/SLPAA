    From movement: "Note that the program will generate two identical linked modules when you select either of the options that apply to both hands, and any future edits to either module will also apply to the other. See :ref:`timing_page` for more details."

**Introduction. Link to: x-slot glossary entry, global settings (options wrt generation of x-slots as well as subdivisions), auto-generation, mention timing as relevant to selecting sign type/phasing options.**

.. _adding_x_slots:

1. Adding x-slots
`````````````````

**Description** You can choose whether the number of x-slots is manually specified by the user for each sign before coding, or if it will be automatically determined by the program based on the movement modules, or you can choose to disable the use of x-slots completely.

Notes: Explain what an x-slot does/does not represent. Explain partial x-slots at the end, and internal divisions within complete x-slots (what works best here for concrete examples? contact/location/handpart?). Focus on functionality first, then give some examples of why these features may be useful for specific signs.

.. note::
    Depending on your choices of how to interact with x-slots, the step to start adding modules to a sign may come at different points in the coding process.
    
    If :ref:`x-slots<x_slot>` and :ref:`auto-generation<auto_gen>` are both enabled, then code the **movement module(s)** for the sign immediately after entering the :ref:`sign_level_info` and coding the :ref:`sign_type_module`. The movement information is used by the program to generate the appropriate number of x-slots for the sign, and then you'll be able to move on to other sign modules.

    If :ref:`x-slots<x_slot>` are enabled but :ref:`auto-generation<auto_gen>` is not, then you must add the appropriate number of x-slots first before adding any modules at all to the sign.

    See :ref:`global_settings` for more about the program's default behaviour, and how to change these options.
