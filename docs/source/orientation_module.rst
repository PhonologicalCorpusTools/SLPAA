Orientation Module
******************

This :ref:`module` is used to code the (absolute) **orientation** components of a sign. As many :ref:`instances<instance>` of this module as necessary can be called for any given sign coding. For more discussion on the use of modules in SLP-AA to encode information about signs, see :ref:`modularity`. 

Select the hand(s) involved in this instance of the module.

Module instances link to generic :ref:`x-slots<x_slot>` to record information about their timing relative to any others within a sign. For more information on the use of x-slots in SLP-AA, consult :ref:`timing_page`.

See :ref:`global_settings` for options about how orientation modules can be auto-generated based on movement modules. The absolute orientation of the hand is described in two ways, firstly you will select the palm direction and then the finger root direction. These terms will be further explained below in their respective sections. Both palm direction and finger root direction must be coded for a full and accurate coding of absolute orientation.

Note that directions on the horizontal axis can be set to either be defined in **absolute** (H1 side / H2 side) or **relative** (:ref:`ipsilateral` / :ref:`contralateral`) directions. The default option for Orientation is to use relative directions, but this can be changed for each module in the :ref:`global_settings`.

The selection options included in this module are outlined below:
        
**1) Palm direction**

Palm direction refers to the direction that the friction surface of the hand (minus the fingers) is facing. When selecting palm direction, you are able to maximally make one selection from each set of options. In the sign `GAME <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=game>`_, the palm direction would be coded as *distal*.
     
**2) Finger root direction**

Finger root direction refers to the direction that the fingertips would be pointing if they were to be fully extended. You can maximally select one from each set of options; that is, you may combine two or more columns if more than one of the direction options is involved. In the sign `GAME <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=game>`_, the finger root direction would be coded as *contralateral*.
