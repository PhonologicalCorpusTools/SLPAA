.. comment::
    From sign type: "Everything is mirrored / in phase" should be selected if location, handshape, and orientation are all mirrored / in phase (synchronized). Signs are considered to be mirrored / in phase when both hands have the same specification at the same time; signs are considered to be not mirrored / out of phase when the hands have opposite specifications at the same time; see :ref:`signing space<signing_space_page>` for more information.

Symmetry, Planes & Axes
***********************

This page will describe and define the terminology used throughout SLP-AA and here in its documentation in reference to the signing space on and surrounding the body. There is a fairly high level of complexity when dealing with motion in three-dimensional space, but our aim is that the visual and textual descriptions here will help to reduce any difficulty in interpreting the program's options and adapting them to the requirements of the individual user. 

.. _axes_entry:

1. Axes and straight movements
``````````````````````````````

**Introduction. Keep in mind that the system was altered so that an axis/axes can be selected without a direction.**

.. _axes_section:

I. Axes
=======

The system used in this program to describe the ``modules`` **(link to glossary definition OR modularity page)** for each sign component depends on an understanding of the three ``cardinal axes`` **(link to glossary definition)**: **horizontal**, **vertical**, and **mid-sagittal**.

These axes can be described in reference to any given point on the signer's body or in the general signing space, depending on what is required for the situation. The vertical axis extends in a straight line up and down, the horizontal extends to the left and right, and the mid-sagittal axis extends forwards and backwards. These can be seen here:

.. comment:: 
    This image should be replaced with one that shows the three cardinal axes relative to the signer's body, with some logical origin point selected. Directions (e.g. proximal/distal) should not be indicated for now. This might be easiest to accomplish if we use a still image of one of us and superimpose the system of axes over it, maybe from two angles if that's helpful.

...

There is a good amount of flexibility in the program for users to decide on an interpretation of the axis system that suits their needs. The axes can be defined relative to the positioning of the signer's body or the direction that they're facing, or to a relevant part of the body. The central point of origin can be adapted as necessary for the situation and the user's definition, as long as the cardinal axes are always oriented in the same way relative to each other.

**Remark on possibility of angled vectors (which we still call axis directions) through combinations of axes.)**

.. _axis_directions:

II. Axis directions
===================

**Introduction**

.. _axis_default:

a) Default directions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Definition (and illustration) of the default set of directions along each axis.**

.. _axis_symmetry:

b) Symmetry in the horizontal axis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Complications from the horizontal axis in particular and any combinations involving it, the left/right system, interchangeability of the two horizontal systems, implications for 'same' direction in** :ref:`sign type<sign_type_module>`.

[The issue with what horizontal symmetry even means: if the hands are moving towards each other, are they moving in the same direction? or if they're both moving to the signer's left, are they moving in the same direction? This is an issue with definition: the same in terms of what?]

.. note::
    There is no articulatory difference between the right hand moving to left or in the contralateral direction. There can, however, be a lexical difference for signs that are defined to move in a particular direction. This is the case for `EAST <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=east>`_ and `WEST <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=west>`_, which are specified to move to the right and left, respectively [reference the ASL dictionary (pgs. 198 and 820)? or somewhere else that this is indicated concretely].

.. comment::
    From the 'to mention' doc: One example of where right-left rather than ipsi-contra distinction is useful, if not necessary, is indicating (referential?) signs, as described in Johnson & Liddell 2021 (p. 136-138). Maybe give this example?
    
    Resolved by giving examples of EAST and WEST? Reference J&L.

.. _angled_axes:

c) Directions in combinations of axes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An axis direction can be specified to be angled by selecting multiple component directions from the applicable cardinal axes. (Take out the passive voice here and make the language more straightforward.)

**How to approach combinations of axes. Mention again that these must be considered to be additive in a single module, not sequential.** (Use `FOCUS <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=focus>`_ and `SNOW_2 <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=snow_2>`_ as examples.)

    From the 'to mention' doc: It might be useful to give some examples of how our perceptual movement direction combination (e.g., up-ipsi, etc.) correspond to Johnson & Liddell’s (2021) vertical and horizontal “directions of bearing” (p.140-141, fig. 8-9)

.. _planes_entry:

2. Planes and circular movements
````````````````````````````````

**Introduction**

.. _planes_section:

I. Planes
=========

.. warning::
    To be able to cover everything below the 'Planes' node, background information required includes: the basics of ipsi/contra and left/right; potentially a little in-depth discussion of normal vectors (though hopefully not strictly necessary here, and likely not in those words); basic knowledge of the axis directions applicable for both of the cardinal axes that form a basis for each plane; etc.
    
    Be sure that these are adequately covered above.

We can also describe a set of planes, where each one is formed by a pair of the cardinal axes described above...

These are the **horizontal**, **vertical**, and **mid-sagittal** planes. 

**(In this diagram, the signer would be facing toward the front side of the cube, looking out of the screen.)**

.. image:: images/shared_planes.png
    :width: 750
    :align: left

.. comment::
    I made this image in a few minutes in a google doc, but it's not the best visual since the orientation of the planes relative to the signer is unclear this way. I would want something more like the image shown `here <https://learnmuscles.com/glossary/cardinal-planes-of-the-body/>`_, which might be easiest to replicate if we use a still image of one of us and superimpose the system of axes over it.

Note that there is a good amount of flexibility in this system for defining planes relative to the positioning of the signer's body or the direction that they're facing, and that the central point of origin is not rigidly defined and can be adapted however necessary. The cardinal planes must be oriented in the same way relative to each other, ...

.. _angled_planes:

a) Combinations of planes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Describe angled planes here for non-straight shapes without circular direction.** ... Planes on an angle are made up of component combinations of two or all three of the cardinal planes.

.. _circular_directions:

II. Circular directions
=======================

**Introduction. Note that horizontal movements are dependent on the system for horizontal axis movements, so the choice for absolute or relative directions will have an impact here as well.** 

.. _top_of_circle:

a) 'Top' of a circle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**State the point on a circle in each plane that we define to be the top of a circle in that plane. Note especially that this notion is independent from movement. Then introduce the idea of circular directionality (in movement) as defined by the (axis) direction of movement through the topmost point for that plane. Needs a set of diagrams. Follow the order as required in the next section: describe the mid-sagittal plane, then vertical, then horizontal.**

.. _plane_default:

b) Default directions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Definition (and possibly illustration) of default directions, in reference to the top of the circle. Start with the mid-sagittal plane to describe the simple case, then the vertical, then horizontal.**

.. _plane_symmetry:

c) Symmetry in planes involving the horizontal axis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Complications from the horizontal axis in particular, i.e. for the vertical and horizontal planes and any combinations involving these, the left/right system, interchangeability of the two horizontal systems, implications for 'same' direction in sign type.**

.. _angled_circles:

d) Circular shapes in combinations of planes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes circular shapes are traced within an angled plane rather than one of the cardinal planes, as in `SOCIALIZE <https://www.handspeak.com/word/index.php?id=2014>`_ and `TWIRL <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=twirl>`_. In this case, code the orientation of the plane of movement by selecting the applicable component planes, as described :ref:`above<angled_planes>`, and code the direction within the angled plane by selecting the component directions within the component planes as well. See the following illustration for how this works:

.. image:: images/mov_combinations_of_planes.png
    :width: 750
    :align: left

In this example, the sign includes the black circle traced out in an angled plane. The information to record in the program is then the directionalities indicated for the red and blue circles, which are situated in cardinal planes. The idea is that the angled circle could be 'flattened' into each of its components, and then the resulting circular directions are simpler to record and analyze.

Here is an example of a possible coding for `SOCIALIZE <https://www.handspeak.com/word/index.php?id=2014>`_ for each hand:

.. image:: images/mov_sample_sign_SOCIALIZE_H1.png
    :width: 750
    :align: left

.. image:: images/mov_sample_sign_SOCIALIZE_H2.png
    :width: 750
    :align: left

Note that the axis direction as selected here describes the position of the hand at the midpoint of the first circle relative to its position at the beginning of the movement. (See the note on :ref:`axis direction for circular shapes<axis_direction_entry>` for more information).

.. _symmetry_review:

III. The signing space
======================

**Detailed summary for quick reference, consisting mostly of a set of visuals and sign examples.**

**Quick and simple review of everything mentioned so far in terms of the basics of planes and axes, i.e. put these together with detailed illustrating images and just go for an overview of our cartesian system and the labels for each component. Focus on the competing options for describing horizontal symmetry. Hopefully this will be a good way to easily reference the important information without digging through the whole page.**

.. image:: images/placeholder.png
    :width: 750
    :align: left

.. comment::
    This placeholder should be replaced with a detailed image that shows a full summary of the set of cardinal axes and planes with all possible directions labelled appropriately (including both sets of options for directions involving the horizontal axis), preferably with a demonstrated reference to the direction of the signer's body. This might be easiest to accomplish if we use a still image of one of us and superimpose the relevant information over top of it.
    
.. note::
    **A note on repeated terminology**
    
    There are several places throughout the program where similar or identical terms are used for slightly different contexts. Take care to note the sign component that any given word is meant to be describing to be sure that your choice is accurate.
    
    For example, the words :ref:`<ipsilateral>` and :ref:`<contralateral>` can be applied for any (or all) of the movement direction, location, or hand orientation descriptions of a sign:
    
    * In `RAINBOW <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=rainbow>`_, the dominant hand moves in the ipsilateral **direction** (toward the signer's right, in this case), and it changes **location** from the contralateral to the ipsilateral side of the body. The **orientation** of the hand changes in the production of the sign, starting with the finger roots pointing down and the palm facing the ipsilateral direction and finishing with the finger roots pointing up and the palm facing the contralateral direction.
    * In `SLICE_2 <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=slice_2>`_, the dominant hand moves in a proximal and ipsilateral **direction** (toward the signer's right, in this case), but its **location** starts on the contralateral side and ends at the midline of the body without ever crossing over to the ipsilateral side. The **orientation** of the hand is unchanging, with the finger roots angled in the distal and contralateral directions and the palm angled to face the proximal and contralateral directions.
    
    These descriptions may be confusing at first glance. Familiarising yourself with each of the modules' functionalities will help with developing clear and precise transcriptions that take advantage of the high level of detail that is possible to record with the program.

.. _body_location_relative:

3. Body-anchored locations
``````````````````````````

**This section will describe how the information on the rest of this page applies to body-anchored locations in particular (rather than signing space locations, which are defined as relative to either the axis system or an item on the body location list). Important things to mention are that the system is not rigidly-defined in terms of the point of origin and orientation of the system of planes and axes relative to any particular point or direction, but it is important that the planes and axes are defined relative to each other. (It doesn't matter whether the signer turns to face a different direction, moves one part of the body, sits or lies down, etc.)**

.. _symmetry_puzzle:

4. The horizontal axis
``````````````````````

**Introduction.** Note that this entire section is not strictly necessary to include and it can be deleted if it's confusing or in the way.

.. note::
    To include here:
    
    {Introduction to the particular difficulties introduced with horizontal symmetry over any other kind}
    
    -->    {The (set of) mid-sagittal plane(s) as normal to the horizontal axis}
        
    {Anatomical symmetry across the "midline," or whatever terminology}
    
    -->    Terminology: Line of bi-lateral symmetry (from Battison), or plane of horizontal symmetry, or plane of bisection, or other. Which one of these is the clearest/simplest? Is there a term used more often in sign language linguistics or sign language teaching? This cannot be referred to as the mid-sagittal plane, as it must specifically be horizontally central to the body (meanwhile a generic mid-sagittal plane can still be described to either side of the body, depending on the reference point of origin).
    
    {Why the discrepancy? Difficulties in articulation mechanisms}
    
    --> Comment on low instances of simultaneous movement along sufficiently different axes and/or planes for each hand. Link this to difficulties wrapping our heads around complex combinations of movement in the mid-sagittal plane. Like trying to pat your head and rub your stomach, it takes more concentration and effort than moving in what we can easily conceptualize as the 'same' direction, with all of the baggage that that generalization comes along with. (Also link this to our broad categories in sign type for moving 'similarly vs. 'differently' and how restricted the 'simultaneous except location/orientation' options usually are.)
