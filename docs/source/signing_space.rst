    The documentations guidelines outline the information to be represented on this page as a general explanation of body geography, symmetry, planes, axes, the 'top' of a circle in each plane, **anatomical position (?)**, and ipsi-contra definitions.
    
.. comment::
    From sign type: "Everything is mirrored / in phase" should be selected if location, handshape, and orientation are all mirrored / in phase (synchronized). Signs are considered to be mirrored / in phase when both hands have the same specification at the same time; signs are considered to be not mirrored / out of phase when the hands have opposite specifications at the same time; see :ref:`signing space<signing_space_page>` for more information.

Symmetry, Planes & Axes

**Introduction**

This page will describe the complexities of the three-dimensional signing space on and surrounding the body and explain the relevant terminology used throughout the program and here in its documentations.

.. note::
    Movement *direction* vs. static *location*. Use the left/right distinction relative to the intrinsic midline of the body. Grab a couple of sign examples to demonstrate. 
    
    Use the system overview to flag down every section where this will be relevant to think about, or otherwise just mention that it should be kept in mind for similar or identical descriptions used in differing contexts. Probably both.
    
    **Note** that the placement of this whole note may end up moving, but for now I like it here.

**Introduction**

The system used in this program to describe location, direction of movement, orientation, ..., **(add references here to specific places where this information is required)**, depends on an understanding of the three ordinate axes: **horizontal**, **vertical**, and **mid-sagittal**.

Each axis can be described in reference to the signer's body. The vertical axis extends in a straight line up and down, the horizontal extends to the left and right, and the mid-sagittal axis extends forwards and backwards. These can be seen here:

==================

**Introduction**

.. _axis_default:

a) Default directions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Definition (and possibly illustration) of default directions**

.. _axis_symmetry:

b) Symmetry in the horizontal axis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Complications from the horizontal axis in particular and any combinations involving it, the left/right system, interchangeability of the two horizontal systems, implications for 'same' direction in sign type**

.. _combinations_axes:

c) Combinations of axes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**How to approach combinations of axes. Mention again that these must be considered to be additive in a single module, not sequential.**

.. warning::
    To be able to cover everything below the 'Planes' node, background information required includes: the basics of ipsi/contra and left/right; potentially a little in-depth discussion of normal vectors (though hopefully not strictly necessary here, and likely not in those words); basic knowledge of the axis directions applicable for the (two) ordinate axes that form a basis for each plane; ...

.. warning::
    It is **possible**, though perhaps too technically involved, to include notions like: sets of parallel planes; normal vectors; spans; cartesian coordinate triples in space; movement vector triples in space; etc.
    
    It is **likely** that we will need to include notions like: movement relative to a starting point (vectors, though we don't have to call it that); vectors parallel to/able to form bases for ordinate axes; vector addition (though we won't call it that); etc.

**Introduction**

Along with the set of axes, we can also describe a similar set of (ordinate) planes: **horizontal**, **vertical**, and **mid-sagittal**. These are each formed along...

II. The signing space
=====================

**Detailed summary for quick reference, consisting mostly of a set of visuals and sign examples.**

**Quick and simple review of everything mentioned so far in terms of the basics of planes and axes, i.e. put these together with detailed illustrating images and just go for an overview of our cartesian system and the labels for each component. Focus on the competing options for describing horizontal symmetry.**

It was taken from https://www.physical-solutions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Understanding-Planes-and-Axes-of-Movement.pdf, and it's similar to what I would want to have here other than some alterations to the plane and axis labels**

**All above information as applicable to smaller locations and/or on-body locations. Needs more planning, and will likely be coordinated with the Location module documentations. For now this is just a general concept of something we will need later on.**

4. The horizontal axis
``````````````````````

**Introduction. This section is all fun theory and brainbusters! Everything above this is necessary to understand for the program, but from here onwards is for additional and not-strictly-necessary information.**

.. note::
    To include here:
    
    {Introduction to the particular difficulties introduced with horizontal symmetry over any other kind}
    -->    {The (set of) mid-sagittal plane(s) as normal to the horizontal axis}
        
    {Anatomical symmetry across the "midline," or whatever terminology}
    -->    Terminology: Line of bi-lateral symmetry (from Battison), or plane of horizontal symmetry, or plane of bisection, or other. Which one of these is the clearest/simplest? Is there a term used more often in sign language linguistics or sign language teaching? This cannot be referred to as the mid-sagittal plane, as it must specifically be horizontally central to the body (meanwhile a generic mid-sagittal plane can still be described to either side of the body).
    
    {Why the discrepancy? Difficulties in articulation mechanisms}
    --> Comment on low instances of simultaneous movement along sufficiently different axes and/or planes for each hand, e.g. an axis on one hand AND a plane on the other. Link this to difficulties wrapping our heads around complex combinations of movement in the mid-sagittal plane. Like trying to pat your head and rub your stomach, it takes more concentration and effort than moving in what we can easily conceptualize as the 'same' direction, with all of the baggage that that generalization comes along with.
