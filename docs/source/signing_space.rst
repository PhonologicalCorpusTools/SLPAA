    find two signs for direction/location distinction
    what is meant by 'anatomical position'?
    references? need any other than what we have?
    graphics! diagrams! visuals! to use as placeholders and references for someone else to do properly.
    
.. comment::
    I want to stay away from using "absolute" and "relative" as much as possible for the directions on the horizontal axis as this may get confusing, especially if we end up using these terms to describe orientation (is this still happening?). Instead I tend towards just using ipsi/contra and left/right.
    
.. comment:: 
    The documentations guidelines outline the information to be represented on this page as a general explanation of body geography, symmetry, planes, axes, the 'top' of a circle, **anatomical position (?)**, and ipsi-contra definitions.

***********************
Symmetry, Planes & Axes
***********************

**Introduction** This section will describe the complexities of the three-dimensional signing space on and surrounding the body to give more context to the terminology and labels used throughout the program and in the documentations.

.. note::
    **To explain here**: There's a difference in using terms like up, right, proximal, contra, etc as an indicator of the direction of movement vs. describing location. It's easiest (I *think*) to focus on the left/right distinction, because it's clear to see that a movement can start on the signer's right and move a little toward the left, but not end up on the left side of the body. The *movement* is leftward, even if the target *location* is not on the left, and the hand does not cross the midpoint of the body. I should have a pretty easy time finding signs like these. SO, although this information is meant to be applied generally across the program, the specific use of a label in one instance should always be kept in mind for that context, even if the same word is applied elsewhere for another context. (Left/right is also better here because there is an intrinsic horizontal midline to the body, but several equally plausible choices for a midpoint for up/down and distal/proximal axes.)

**Introduction**  

.. _axes_entry:

I. Axes
=======

The system used in this program to describe any *location* or *direction* in space depends on an understanding of the three (ordinate) axes: **horizontal**, **vertical**, and **mid-saggital**.

.. warning::
    I would like to have a set of diagrams here of the three axes superimposed on a person, where two axes are in grey and the relevant one is in an eye-catching colour. It might be beneficial to have two diagrams set forward-facing, and the mid-saggital one set as viewed from the signer's right. Otherwise, if the same image is used three times, it should be at a slight angle rather than head-on. 
    
    A few versions of each image should focus on different parts, so that the same viewpoint and sketch-up can be used for both the axis system and the plane directionalities. Axis arrows, for example, would not be useful when showing plane information later on.
    
The directions of movement along each axis form a set of options ...

.. _planes_entry:

II. Planes
==========

Along with the set of axes, we also use a similar set of (ordinate) planes: **horizontal**, **vertical**, and **mid-saggital**. These can be described by their relation to a perpendicular axis ...

.. warning::
    Duplicate the same sets of images from above, but with a plane highlighted instead of an axis. Also include the normal vector to each plane for clarity.

**(Sets of planes? Describe here what is meant by the 'top' of a circle in each plane. Use example signs, and describe how to deal with combinations of planes.)**

.. _symmetry_entry:

2. Symmetry
```````````

**(I wanted to have something here about the symmetrical plane, but this seems like too prominent a placement for that subject. It could be a note tacked on to the section below somewhere instead? Or this could be a general introduction to the problems encountered when describing left/right symmetry, and a note here can go into more detail on why those problems exist for this axis only.)**

.. _lr_ic:

I. Left/right and ipsi/contra models
=====================================

**(Description of what these two options generally entail, and a list of the selections that this choice will affect. Describe the interchangeability of the models. Link to the global settings page for more information about switching between the two. Link to the movement direction relation section in the sign type page! Add examples here, but work out how to stay away from repeating too much information.)**

.. _circular_directions:

II. Circular directions
=======================

**(Description)**

.. note::
    **(Describe what to do about combinations of planes -- look at each component plane separately)**

.. _lr_directions:

a) Left/right-oriented model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**(Describe the clockwise directions for each plane under this model. Also describe these directions in terms of movement across the top of the circle.)**

.. warning::
    A set of similar diagrams to those introduced in the planes & axes section, but this time with one plane highlighted in each image along with its normal vector, shown for clarity. Include diagrams for each hand moving in the 'same' direction (e.g. both moving left from top of circle).

.. _ic_directions:

b) Circular directions for an ipsi/contra-oriented model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**(Describe the circular directions for each plane under this model. Also describe these directions in terms of movement across the top of the circle.)**

.. warning::
    A set of similar diagrams to those introduced in the planes & axes section, but this time with one plane highlighted in each image along with its normal vector, shown for clarity. Include diagrams for each hand moving in the 'same' direction (e.g. both moving contralaterally from top of circle).


.. _notes_comments:

Notes
~~~~~

Note to self, delete this section once each of these is expressed in the main text somewhere:

.. note::
    Absolute directions, relative directions for **axes**: relevant for any vector *involving* the horizontal axis, i.e. any vector that is not normal to the horizontal axis/not contained within a plane that is normal to the horizontal axis.

    Absolute directions, relative directions for **planes**: relevant for any plane *involving* the horizontal axis, i.e. any plane that is not normal to the horizontal axis.
    
    ... Okay, this suggests that the set of mid-saggital planes is more applicable to symmetry than exclusively the body midpoint/line of bi-lateral symmetry. I could leave that out and still have everything come across perfectly clearly, but it would still be fun/useful to include for background information as to why the horizontal axis has so many more possibilities for movement than any other.
    
.. note::    
    Terminology: Line of bi-lateral symmetry (from Battison), or maybe just plane of horizontal symmetry? The plane of bisection? (Does the choice of terminology matter more than the clarity of its meaning?) Which one of these is the clearest/simplest? Is there a term used more often in sign language linguistics or sign language teaching in general?
