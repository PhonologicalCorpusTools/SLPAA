    references? need any other than what we have?
    graphics! diagrams! visuals!
    
.. comment::
    I want to stay away from using "absolute" and "relative" as much as possible for the directions on the horizontal axis as this may get confusing, especially if we end up using these terms to describe orientation. Instead I tend towards just using ipsi/contra and left/right.

.. _signing_space:

***********************
Symmetry, Planes & Axes
***********************

This section will describe the complexities of the three-dimensional signing space on and surrounding the body to give more context to the terminology and labels used throughout the program and in the documentations.

.. _planes_axes:

1. Planes and axes
``````````````````

The system used in this program to describe any location or direction in space depends on an understanding of the three ordinate directions, which we call the **horizontal**, **vertical**, and **mid-saggital** axes. 

.. warning::
    I would like to have a set of diagrams here of the three axes superimposed on a person, where two axes are in grey and the relevant one is in an eye-catching colour. It might be beneficial to have two of them forward-facing, and the mid-saggital one as viewed from the signer's right. Otherwise, if the same image is used three times, it should be at a slight angle rather than head-on.
    
The directions along each axis ...

**(Sets of planes?)**

.. _symmetrical_plane:

I. (TBD)
========

Line of bi-lateral symmetry (from Battison), or maybe just plane of horizontal symmetry? The plane of bisection? does the terminology matter more than the clarity of its meaning? which one of these is the clearest?

.. _lr_ic:

II. Left/right and ipsi/contra models
=====================================



.. _lr_clockwise:

a) Clockwise directions for a left/right-oriented model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



.. _ic_clockwise:

b) Clockwise directions for an ipsi/contra-oriented model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~






.. note::
    Note to self, delete once this is expressed in the main text somewhere:
    
    Absolute directions, relative directions for axes: relevant for any vector *involving* the horizontal axis, i.e. any axis that is not solely contained within a mid-saggital plane.

    Absolute directions, relative directions for planes: relevant for any plane *involving* the horizontal axis, i.e. any plane that is not solely a mid-saggital plane.
    
    ... okay, this suggests that the set of mid-saggital planes is more applicable than exclusively the line of bi-lateral symmetry. I could probably leave that out and have everything come across perfectly clearly, but it could still be a fun
