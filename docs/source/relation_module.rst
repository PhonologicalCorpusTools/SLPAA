    change everything here to conform to new Relation module

.. comment::
    Signs with a contact module include a subset of Brentari’s (1998) ‘tracing’ signs, like `BLACK <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=black>`_ (no contact – this would be coded as ‘body anchored’ in location + ‘near contact’ in the contact module) and `LONG <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=long>`_.

.. _relation_module:

***************
Relation Module
***************

This :ref:`module` is used to code the ``contact`` components of a sign. As many :ref:`instances<instance>` of this module as necessary can be called for any given sign coding. For more discussion on the use of modules in SLP-AA to encode information about signs, see :ref:`modularity`.

Select the hand(s) involved in this instance of the module.

Module instances link to generic :ref:`x-slots<x_slot>` to record information about their timing relative to any others within a sign. For more information on the use of x-slots in SLP-AA, consult :ref:`timing_page`.

**Linking modules:** List of instances of Location coded already. Also allow 'not linked to a location module' e.g. to code contact between hands in neutral space for signs like `DESTROY <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=destroy>`_.

**Contact options:**

* Contact
* No contact

Distance:

    * Far
    * Medium
    * Close

I. Contact Manner
==================

**Contact manner:** Only if this instance of the module is linked to an interval/intervals, not single points in time. All selected instances will have the same value. To record different values, generate separate instances of the module.

* Holding (`DIRTY <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=dirty>`_, `APPLE <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=apple>`_, `SHOW <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=show>`_)
* Continuous (`NICE <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=nice>`_)
* Intermittent (`SALT <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=salt>`_, `BEACH <https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=beach>`_)
