.. todo::
    text descriptions! very many
    add blurb for discontiguous ipsi/contra selectable areas
        this can be copy/pasted to mention that each half can be selected separately
    add images of each "zoomed-in" and selected location
        as this would be seen in the navigation window

.. _predefined_locations:

********************
Predefined Locations
********************

.. warning::
    At the moment, this is a very rough list with the full set of information available in the Location/orientation spreadsheet, but none of it is explained or cleaned up to be understood by someone outside the team. It needs a lot of text descriptions filled in to make sense, and the intention is that every listed area will eventually have a matching image to show what it would look like as the selected area in the (zoomed-in) image view of the Location/Hand Part module.

(**Introduction:** Give a quick overview of our predefined locations, link to sources we used in consideration while building this list, mention the specificity available from the suboptions. Especially comment on how the highlighted areas in each image are meant to be used as a reference, not a strict definition. The text labels are the only recorded information in each module, so they can be defined in a different way internally if the user wishes.)

**(Will we still have a mechanism to add more user-defined locations? What might this look like?)**
