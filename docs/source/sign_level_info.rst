*********************
Sign Level Information
*********************

**add overall description of what this section is for**

Here's an example reference [Morgan2017]_; note that the reference is in square brackets and ends with an underscore. On ReadtheDocs, it will be a blue linked text, but the text will match the exact material in the square brackets.

Here's an example of a glossary item: :ref:`sample_2`. On ReadtheDocs, it will be blue linked text, but the actual text that is the 'section heading' ('Sample 2') will be used instead of the name of the link ('sample_2'), which allows for nicer formatting and multi-word glossary items.

0. Entry ID
``````````
The :ref:`entry_ID` will be generated automatically by SLP-AA. See :ref:`global_options` for how to set preferences.

.. _gloss_entry:    

# [Note to April: because 'gloss' is also an entry in the glossary, it will have the plain .. _gloss: label as its reference target. Let's use .._xx_entry to mark reference targets for the same named elements but in the description of where users enter the information.]

1. Gloss
``````````

Write the [gloss]_ for the sign **(sign lang convention is to put in CAPS?)**. This is a word, or set of words, used to identify the sign in a spoken/written language so as to be able to talk about the sign. **(link to definition in glossary?)** [Note to April: given that we will be defining in the glossary and linking to that definition, this is a place where you don't need to re-define it in the documentation. Rule of thumb is to write information only once. :) --Kathleen (and you can delete this comment when you're done with it] 




.. _lemma_entry:

2. Lemma
``````````
Write the lemma for the sign (in CAPS or lowercase?). The lemma is a unique identifyer for the target sign **(link to glossary definition)**



.. _source:

3. Source
``````````
Write the name of the source **meta-data**




.. _signer:

4. Signer
``````````
Select from dropdown menu.

These notes will be attached to the particular sign in the corpus.

Choose from one of the options L or R for the signer. **If unknown, default is R.** -- see "global options" for this
