Movement Module
******************

**(What this module is used for and how it works. Mention especially that this should be the 
first module coded other than sign-level and sign type, and that this is used to generate x-slots. 
Link to the section on/glossary definition of x-slots as well.)**

Any movement in a sign can be described as a perceptual shape **(Link to a glossary definition 
of 'perceptual shape')** or a joint-specific movement **(Link to a glossary definition of 
'joint-specific movement')**.

1. Movement type - Perceptual shape

I. Shape
=========

**(Describe the shape options, show some sample signs)**

II. Axis Direction
===================

An axis of movement (or a combination of axes) can be selected for any movement with
perceptual shape. **(Link to a separate .rst file in the docs on planes, axes, and divisions of 
neutral space)** 

The axis direction encodes the endpoint of the movement relative to the starting pointâ€¦ **(use
example signs)**

III. Plane
==========

**(Describe the default options for clockwise directionality. Note that the option to
select a plane is not necessary for straight paths, but the option is not disabled for straight
paths (?))** [Note for Nico: you can use a cross-reference to the global options in order to actual describe the default options, e.g., "See :ref:`global_options` to set preferences." --Kathleen]
