Movement Module
***************

**(What this module is used for and how it works. Mention especially that this should be the first module coded other than sign-level and sign type, and that this is used to generate x-slots. Link to the section on/glossary definition of x-slots as well.)**

Any individual movement component in a sign can be described as either a :ref:`perceptual_shape` or a :ref:`joint_specific1c_movement`. **(More fine-grained articulatory detail can be added by specifying other joint movements involved in the production of each component...)**

.. _movement_type_perceptual_shape:

1. Movement type - Perceptual shape
````````````````````````````````````

.. _shape_entry:

I. Shape
=========

**(Describe the shape options, show some sample signs)**

.. _axis_direction_entry:

II. Axis Direction
===================

An axis of movement (or a combination of axes) can be selected to describe the direction of any movement with perceptual shape. **(Link to a separate .rst file in the docs on planes, axes, and divisions of neutral space)** 

The axis direction encodes the endpoint of the movement relative to the starting pointâ€¦ **(use example signs)**

.. _plane_entry:

III. Plane
==========

**(Describe the default options for clockwise directionality. Note that the option to select a plane is not necessary for straight paths, but the option is not disabled for straight paths (?))** [Note for Nico: you can use a cross-reference to the global options in order to actual describe the default options, e.g., "See :ref:`global_options` to set preferences." --Kathleen]

.. _movement_type_joint_specific_movements:

2. Movement type - Joint-specific movements

.. _joint_movements_entry:

3. Joint movements

**(Important to mention: this section can freely combine with either movement type, the applicable joint movements for any joint-specific movement is auto-filled)**
