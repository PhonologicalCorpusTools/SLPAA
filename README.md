# SLP-Annotator/Analyzer

One of the barriers to conducting corpus-based phonetic and phonological research on signed languages is the lack of tools for 
streamlining phonetic annotation in a way that is then compatible with other corpus-analysis resources. SLP-Annotator/Analyzer is a free, open-
source software program that is designed to implement a (slightly modified) version of Johnson 
and Liddell’s anatomically based and phonetically detailed Sign Language Phonetic Annotation (SLPA) system (2010, 2011a, 2011b, 2012). The current version of the software encodes only handshape information, but we are actively working on expanding it to cover location, movement, orientation, and non-manual information as well.
 
  
SLP-AA follows the guidelines laid out in Tkachman et al. (2016) to modify SLPA. Specifically, each handshape annotation 
consists of exactly 34 slots, each of which can consist of a pre-determined list of annotations (see Fig. 1). Completely standardizing 
the input format of each transcription makes it possible to (a) facilitate the transcription process by providing the transcriber with 
both visual and written information about what can be entered into each slot; (b) provide automatic checks for inaccurate 
transcriptions (e.g., warning users when they enter anatomically or phonologically implausible configurations); (c) create automatically
rendered images of the transcribed handshape, facilitating readability and human-led accuracy checks; and (d) create 
corpora that are compatible with automated analysis. For example, after creating corpora using SLPAnnotator, one could test claims about sign language phonology and typology, such as the proposal in Johnson and Liddell (2011b: 21) that when the 
proximal joints are all extended, the fourth finger is always abducted. This can be done by searching for certain finger configurations
in a corpus, in a manner similar to how PCT allows searching for words with segments matching specific phonological features. SLP-AA will
also makes it easy to run a variety of common analyses that have rarely, or never, been used with sign languages, such as calculations
of functional load or neighbourhood density.
