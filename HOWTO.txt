Prerequisites:

pip install pymupdf

get a copy of the Canadian ASL dictionary, call it 'dictionary.pdf' and put it in the docs/ folder

Access to Google Drive and Google Colab. You also need around 250MB of free space on your drive to store your trained model artifacts. 

To fine-tuning the T5 model:

Step 1: Extract dictionary text
Run parse_pdf.py
This outputs a file called 'dictionary_text_extraction.txt'

Step 2: Extract glosses and descriptions
Run parse_text.py
This parses the file from the previous step, to extract the gloss and description from each dictionary entry. It also searches each entry for any mention of a predefined hand shape, and outputs a file called 'description_to_handshape.csv' You can use this file to fine-tune the T5 model. Upload this file to your google drive.

Step 3: Set up your notebook
Upload the file T5_transcriber.ipynb to your drive, and open it in Google Colab. Go to the "Runtime" menu in Colab, select "Change runtime type", and choose "T4 GPU" if it's available (otherwise leave it at CPU). You'll have to modify some file paths in the code, or else create directories to match. Note that file paths in google drive always start with the prefix '/content/drive/MyDrive/' 

Step 4: Train a model
Run all cells in the notebook. Training the model takes 3-4 hours on a CPU but just 1-2 minutes on a GPU. A folder full of model artifacts will be saved on your drive, and you only need to retrain the model if you make changes to your training data. 

Step 5: Evaluate a model
To see how the model performs on a given input, use the inference() function. If you want to evaluate a model you trained earlier, then use the load_model() function. 

If you want to test a model you trained earlier, then you only need to run the the load_model() function, which takes a folder name and returns a T5 model object.
